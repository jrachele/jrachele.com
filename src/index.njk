  <p>I am a 22 year old graduate student from Greenville, South Carolina. I was born in Arizona though and lived there for 8 years, so is that where I'm actually "from"? Seems to be a bit ambiguous. I'm American, I guess. Like many scatterbrained children of the internet, I have a wide range of interests of varying utility.</p>
  <p>Food is basically everything. We are all spinning out of control on this spec of dust, so why not enjoy some tasty flavor combinations?</p>
