## Why?

... Why not?

Seems like everyone has a blog these days, and it would be a nice place to put down my thoughts.
This week is the week of the 2020 US Presidential Election; it's definitely a turbulent time and there's tension in the air. This seems like a pretty good way to relax.

<br>

This blog itself is made with a static site generator (11ty), and hopefully loaded pretty quickly for you.
The nice thing is that I can theoretically write my blog anywhere and immediately update it just by pushing a markdown file to GitHub. Neato.

## How?

The blog uses a few things:
+ [11ty static site generator](11ty.dev)
+ [TailwindCSS for minimal styling](tailwindcss.com)
+ [Alpine.js for lightweight responsive UI](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)

<br>

Setting it up is pretty simple. I plan to make a full tutorial series for setting up the blog alongside a personal portfolio of sorts.
Hopefully it will be easy to follow without glaring flaws. I mostly found what I was looking for online, but I will admit that the documentation and terminology surrounding 11ty was slightly confusing, so maybe I'll be able to clear a few things up.
