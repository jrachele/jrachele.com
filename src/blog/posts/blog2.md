## Back in the lab

It's been a while. I planned to make a series of blog posts detailing how I set up this blog but then that dream kind of fizzled out. Last week the COVID restrictions lifted up in the lab. This has done wonders for my productivity to be honest. 

Although this goes without saying, I'm going to say it anyway: solitary confinement is cruel and unusual punishment. After we as a society have been collectively put in solitary for at least some period of time this past year it's no wonder nobody has any social skills anymore. 

As far as my computer scientist life is concerned, I have been applying for jobs and studying for interviews. I am currently learning more about Typescript and Socket.io in the hopes that I can make a fun party game Ã  la Jackbox for my friends and I to play together. It's been fun.

I may even decide to post a series of blog posts on how I did that, but that is contingent on how much longer my manic coding spree lasts. We shall see. 

I would say adios here to sound laid back and carefree, but it's a little dramatic. Isn't it odd that Spanish speakers end their conversations with what essentially translates to 'catch you after we're dead lmao!'. Adios = to/until God. Pretty dramatic. 

With that said,

**Adieu**
